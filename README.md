# RocketModToOpenMod
Converts RocketMod data files to OpenMod data files.

NOTE: This is not mandatory for the RocketMod link plugin. The point of this is to be a flawless way of having concrete, converted files instead of using the built in PermissionLink (which is more prone to bugs). PermissionLink currently only alters the permissions used at runtime. 

## Usability

Supports:

- [x] Permissions

- [x] Some parts of user data

- [ ] Core Translations

File Types:

* XML - Read/Write

* YAML - Write

* JSON - Write
