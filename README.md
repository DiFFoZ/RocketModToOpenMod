# RocketModToOpenMod
Converts RocketMod data files to OpenMod data files.

NOTE: This is not mandatory for the RocketMod link plugin. The point of this is to be a flawless way of having concrete, converted files instead of using the built in PermissionLink (which is more prone to bugs). PermissionLink currently only alters the permissions used at runtime. 

## Instructions

1. Grab the latest release from the releases page

2. Shove the exe file inside your Rocket Folder. For example, C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Unturned\your_server\Rocket

3. Run the exe

4. A new folder named OpenMod will be generated

To save to XML or JSON, use cmd and run the exe file with the args json or xml.
