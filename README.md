# RocketModToOpenMod
Converts RocketMod data files to OpenMod data files.

NOTE: This is not mandatory for the RocketMod link plugin. The point of this is to be a flawless way of having concrete, converted files instead of using the built in PermissionLink (which is more prone to bugs). PermissionLink currently only alters the permissions used at runtime. 

## Usability

* Permissions

Expected to support:

* Core Translations

File Types
